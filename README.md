# Escape-the-Text-Game
A basic text based game that reads from 2 JSON files for location and object data in Java. There is also the ability to save and load (creates a .txt file) throughout the game.

Features:
- Pickup objects
- Drop objects
- Use objects
- Fight a boss
- Maze Puzzle
- Save game

I am hoping to add more to this game and possibly change some things to make it more efficent as I learn more about Java. Any updates I do make will be written below along with any changed or updated features.
